# InFeed
InFeed is a forum website for people to share opinions or information simply on a feed! There is also a reputation system in the form of cookies to determine credibility, but also an interaction lock based system to avoid misinterpretation or skimming posts!

## Heroku Deployed App

## Prerequisites for running the server yourself!
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [MongoDB Community Edition](https://www.mongodb.com/try#community)
- [Heroku](https://id.heroku.com/login)
